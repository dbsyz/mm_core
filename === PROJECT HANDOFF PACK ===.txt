=== PROJECT HANDOFF PACK ===
Last updated: 2026-02-25 (UTC)
Project root: c:\Users\syzdy\python\mm_core

1) ONE-LINE GOAL
- Build a reusable market-making data foundation starting with Kraken BTC/EUR live L1 BBO capture, latency analytics, and strict data QA gates.

2) CURRENT STATUS (WORKING / NOT YET BUILT)
- Working now:
- `mm_core/collector.py` captures Kraken WS v2 ticker BBO, writes CSV, prints rolling latency summaries.
- Collector now has reconnect/backoff handling for transient websocket/network/runtime errors.
- Collector supports `--max-seconds` as total session duration across reconnects.
- Clock-offset correction from subscribe ack (`time_in/time_out`) is applied to produce `adjusted_age_ms`.
- `mm_core/analyze.py` computes latency stats + regime shares and defaults to latest contiguous run.
- Analyzer legacy parsing bug fixed: old 11-column rows no longer mis-infer `e2e_since_sub_ms`.
- `mm_core/data_quality_check.py` runs integrity + QA checks and supports strict non-zero exit.
- New automated tests added under `mm_core/tests/` and passing locally.
- Not yet built:
- Fair value baseline script (mid/microprice + 1s directional evaluation).
- Trades/L2 ingestion (still L1 BBO-only stack).
- Adapter-driven runtime migration (framework exists, collector still script-centric).

3) SCOPE
- In-scope now:
- Kraken only.
- Symbol `BTC/EUR` only.
- L1 BBO collection, offline latency analysis, strict QA.
- Out-of-scope now:
- Multi-exchange aggregation.
- L2/L3/trades production ingestion.
- Live quoting engine, routing, execution, and PnL backtesting stack.

4) CONSTRAINTS
- Platform: Windows + PowerShell + local venv `test_venv`, Python 3.14.
- Cost: Kraken public WS only, no paid infra.
- Security: no secrets required for current data path.
- Data hygiene rule: use unique output file per run (or collector default timestamped output).

5) TECH STACK
- Python 3.14.3
- `websockets==15.0.1`
- Standard library: `asyncio`, `csv`, `argparse`, `dataclasses`, `pathlib`

6) ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
- `collector.py`: live ingestion and raw CSV output with latency fields.
- `analyze.py`: offline run segmentation, latency percentiles, regime shares.
- `data_quality_check.py`: integrity diagnostics + strict QA gate.
- `framework/models.py`: canonical `BBOEvent`.
- `framework/adapters/base.py`: `ExchangeAdapter` protocol.
- `framework/adapters/kraken.py`: Kraken BBO parsing adapter.

7) CSV SCHEMA (DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT VERSIONING)
- Header:
- `capture_time_utc, recv_ts_ms, exchange_ts, exchange_ts_ms, symbol, bid, ask, bid_qty, ask_qty, raw_age_ms, adjusted_age_ms, e2e_since_sub_ms`
- Semantics:
- `raw_age_ms = recv_ts_ms - exchange_ts_ms`
- `adjusted_age_ms = raw_age_ms + clock_offset_ms`
- `e2e_since_sub_ms` is used to split contiguous runs after reconnect/restart.

8) CLI CONTRACTS
- Collect:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe mm_core\collector.py --symbol BTC/EUR [--out <csv>] [--max-seconds N] [--summary-every S]`
- Analyze:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe mm_core\analyze.py --file <csv> [--normal-max-ms X --degraded-max-ms Y] [--all-runs]`
- QA:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe mm_core\data_quality_check.py --file <csv> [--strict] [--all-runs]`

9) IMPORTANT PATHS
- `mm_core/collector.py`
- `mm_core/analyze.py`
- `mm_core/data_quality_check.py`
- `mm_core/tests/test_analyze.py`
- `mm_core/tests/test_collector.py`
- `mm_core/tests/test_data_quality_check.py`
- `mm_core/PLAN_KRAKEN_BTC_EUR.md`
- `mm_core/README.md`
- Legacy duplicate (non-canonical): `c:\Users\syzdy\python\kraken_latency`

10) TESTING STATUS
- Static compile check:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile mm_core\collector.py mm_core\analyze.py mm_core\data_quality_check.py`
- Unit tests:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s mm_core\tests -p "test_*.py" -v`
- Current local result:
- 6 tests passed on 2026-02-25.
- Coverage gaps:
- No integration test harness with replayed websocket fixtures.
- No long-run deterministic test for clock-offset drift behavior.

11) KNOWN RISKS / OPEN ISSUES
- 24h sample `mm_core\out\kraken_bbo_latency_24h_2026-02-22.csv` is poor quality:
- analyzer showed p50 about 1306 ms and unsafe share about 98.64%.
- strict QA failed with backward timestamp share about 5.90% and max backward jump about 19606 ms.
- This indicates either venue timestamp instability in that run, or offset/data path issues.
- Reconnect hardening is in place, but periodic offset refresh / drift guard is still not implemented.
- Repo currently tracks `mm_core/__pycache__/*.pyc`, which creates noisy diffs.

12) DO-NOT-CHANGE LIST
- Keep canonical project root as `mm_core/`.
- Keep collector CSV header/order stable unless explicit schema versioning is introduced.
- Keep analyzer default behavior as latest contiguous run.
- Keep 24h gate thresholds/process in `PLAN_KRAKEN_BTC_EUR.md` unless intentionally revised.

13) NEXT 3 TASKS (ORDERED)
- 1. Implement periodic clock-offset refresh / drift guard in collector.
- Acceptance:
- offset is recomputed at controlled intervals or on reconnect and metrics are monitored for drift.
- 2. Add fair baseline script on BBO data (`mid`, `microprice`, 1s directional evaluation).
- Acceptance:
- reproducible script output with baseline comparison from CSV input.
- 3. Re-run clean 24h collection and gate using strict QA + analyzer fixed thresholds (20/80).
- Acceptance:
- >=23.5h runtime, strict QA pass, and latency stats within plan thresholds.

14) QUICK RUNBOOK
- Install deps:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r mm_core\requirements.txt`
- 15m smoke capture:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe mm_core\collector.py --symbol BTC/EUR --out mm_core\out\sanity_fresh.csv --max-seconds 900`
- Analyze:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe mm_core\analyze.py --file mm_core\out\sanity_fresh.csv --normal-max-ms 20 --degraded-max-ms 80`
- Strict QA:
- `test_venv\Scripts\python.exe mm_core\data_quality_check.py --file mm_core\out\sanity_fresh.csv --strict`

=== NEXT CHAT BOOTSTRAP PROMPT ===
Continue the `mm_core` project at `c:\Users\syzdy\python\mm_core`.

Current status:
- Collector/analyzer/QA scripts are functional.
- Collector includes reconnect/backoff.
- Analyzer legacy parsing bug is fixed.
- Unit tests exist in `mm_core/tests` and pass (6 tests).
- Main unresolved risk is long-run latency quality and potential clock-offset drift.

Immediate priorities:
1) Implement periodic offset refresh/drift guard in `collector.py`.
2) Add a small fair baseline script (mid + microprice + 1s directional check).
3) Update README with baseline command.
4) Re-run clean 24h capture and apply strict QA gate.

Constraints:
- Keep `mm_core/` as canonical root.
- Do not modify legacy `kraken_latency/` unless explicitly requested.
- Do not change CSV schema without explicit versioning.
